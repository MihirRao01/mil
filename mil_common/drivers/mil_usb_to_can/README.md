# MIL USB to CAN
This package contains libraries and scripts for interfacing with the USB to CAN board developed by Rosemond Fabien. Users can specify at runtime a set python classes to handle communication with specific CAN devices.

# Usage
See `launch/example.launch` for an example of how to run the driver. This example will reference an example device handle and simualated device which simply echos out data sent to it. In real applications, the parameters will be changed to handle real devices.
